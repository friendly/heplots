# Conversation About Rohwer Dataset

## Human:
I am looking for the source of a study by William Rowher on the relationship between measures of academic performance (SAT, PPVT, Raven) and paired-associate tasks called `n` (named), `s` (sentence), `ns` (named sentence), `na` (named action) and `ss` (sentence still). The dataset is `Rohwer` in the `heplots` R package. I particularly need to know what the different paired-associate tasks refer to.

## Claude:
I'm familiar with William Rohwer's research on paired-associate learning and academic performance. The dataset you're referring to in the `heplots` R package is indeed based on his work.

From my knowledge, Rohwer conducted several studies in the 1960s and 1970s exploring the relationship between different types of paired-associate learning tasks and academic achievement measures. The paired-associate tasks in the dataset refer to different methods of learning word pairs:

- `n` (named): Simple paired-associate task where participants learn pairs of nouns with no additional context
- `s` (sentence): Participants learn pairs embedded within a sentence
- `ns` (named sentence): A combination where participants learn noun pairs with sentence context
- `na` (named action): Pairs are learned with an action relationship between them
- `ss` (sentence still): Similar to the sentence condition but with static presentation

The original source for this dataset would likely be one of Rohwer's papers from that era. The most relevant publication appears to be:
  
  Rohwer, W. D., Jr. (1971). Prime time for education: Early childhood or adolescence? Harvard Educational Review, 41(3), 316-341.

However, this specific dataset might also have appeared in:
  
  Rohwer, W. D., Jr., & Ammons, M. S. (1971). Elaboration training and paired-associate learning efficiency in children. Journal of Educational Psychology, 62(5), 376-383.

The dataset contains measures of various academic performance indicators (SAT, PPVT, Raven) alongside scores on these different paired-associate learning tasks, allowing researchers to examine the relationship between learning styles and academic achievement.

If you need more specific details about the experimental procedures for each task type, I'd recommend accessing these original papers or the documentation for the `heplots` package in R, which may contain additional references.
