NOTE: BIC calculation prior to latentnet 2.7.0 had a bug in the calculation of the effective number of parameters. See help(summary.ergmm) for details.
NOTE: Prior to version 2.8.0, handling of fixed effects for directed networks had a bug: the covariate matrix was transposed.
Warning messages:
1: package 'network' was built under R version 4.5.2 
2: package 'ergm' was built under R version 4.5.2

NOTE: It is not certain whether it is appropriate to use latentnet's BIC to select latent space dimension, whether or not to include actor-specific random effects, and to compare clustered models with the unclustered model.
