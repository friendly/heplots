bbox3d(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A mesh3d object}

\item{...}{ignored}
}
\value{
A 2 x 3 matrix, giving the minimum and maximum values in the rows and x, y, z coordinates
            in the columns.
}
\description{
Ellipsoids are created by \pkg{rgl} functions as meshes of points, segments, ... from coordinates
in various forms. This function calculates the bounding box, defined as the range of the
