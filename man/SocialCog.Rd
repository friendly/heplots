\description{
The general purpose of the study (Hartman, 2016, Heinrichs et al. (2015))
was to evaluate patterns and levels of performance on neurocognitive
measures among individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder
using a well-validated, comprehensive neurocognitive battery specifically
designed for individuals with psychosis (Heinrichs et al. (2008))
}
\details{
The data here are for a subset of the observations in \code{\link{NeuroCog}}
for which measures on various scales of social cognition were also
available. Interest here is on whether the schizophrenia group can be
distinguished from the schizoaffective group on these measures.

The Social Cognitive measures were designed to tap various aspects of the
perception and cognitive procession of emotions of others.  Emotion
perception was assessed using a Managing Emotions (\code{MgeEmotions}) score
from the MCCB.  A "theory of mind" (\code{ToM}) score assessed ability to
read the emotions of others from photographs of the eye region of male and
female faces. Two other measures, externalizing bias (\code{ExtBias}) and
personalizing bias (\code{PersBias}) were calculated from a scale measuring
the degree to which individuals attribute internal, personal or situational
causal attributions to positive and negative social events.

See \code{\link{NeuroCog}} for a description of the sample. Only those with
complete data on all the social cognitive measures are included in this data
set.

There is one extreme outlier in the schizophrenia group and other possible
outliers in the control group, left in here for tutorial purposes.
