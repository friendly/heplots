\description{
The primary purpose of the study (Hartman, 2016, Heinrichs et al. (2015))
was to evaluate patterns and levels of performance on neurocognitive
measures among individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder
using a well-validated, comprehensive neurocognitive battery specifically
designed for individuals with psychosis (Heinrichs et al. (2008))
}
\details{
The main interest was in determining how well these measures distinguished
among all groups and whether there were variables that distinguished between
the schizophrenia and schizoaffective groups.

Neurocognitive function was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
Battery (MCCB; Nuechterlein et al., 2008). The MCCB consists of 10
individually administered tests that measure cognitive performance in seven
domains: speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal
learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social
cognition.

The clinical sample comprised 116 male and female patients who met the
following criteria: 1) a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 70) or
schizoaffective disorder (n = 46) confirmed by the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders; 2) outpatient status; 3) a history
free of developmental or learning disability; 4) age 18-65; 5) a history
free of neurological or endocrine disorder; and 6) no concurrent DSM-IV-TR
diagnosis of substance use disorder.

Non-psychiatric control participants (n = 146) were screened for medical and
psychiatric illness and history of substance abuse. Patients were recruited
from three outpatient clinics in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Control
participants were recruited through local newspaper and online classified
advertisements for paid research participation.
