\arguments{
\item{mod}{a model object of class \code{"mlm"}.}

\item{\dots}{arguments passed from generic.}

\item{terms}{a logical value or character vector of terms in the model for
which to plot hypothesis matrices; if missing or \code{TRUE}, defaults to
all terms; if \code{FALSE}, no terms are plotted.}

\item{hypotheses}{optional list of linear hypotheses for which to plot
hypothesis matrices; hypotheses are specified as for the
\code{\link[car]{linearHypothesis}} function in the \code{car} package; the
list elements can be named, in which case the names are used.}

\item{term.labels}{logical value or character vector of names for the terms
to be plotted. If \code{TRUE} (the default) the names of the terms are used;
if \code{FALSE}, term labels are not plotted.}

\item{hyp.labels}{logical value or character vector of names for the
hypotheses to be plotted. If \code{TRUE} (the default) the names of
components of the list of hypotheses are used; if \code{FALSE}, hypothesis
labels are not plotted.}

\item{err.label}{Label for the error ellipse}

\item{variables}{indices or names of the three response variables to be
plotted; defaults to \code{1:3}.}

\item{error.ellipsoid}{if \code{TRUE}, plot the error ellipsoid; defaults to
\code{TRUE}, if the argument \code{add} is \code{FALSE} (see below).}

\item{factor.means}{logical value or character vector of names of factors
for which the means are to be plotted, or \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE};
defaults to \code{TRUE}, if the argument \code{add} is \code{FALSE} (see
below).}

\item{grand.mean}{if \code{TRUE}, plot the centroid for all of the data;
defaults to \code{TRUE}, if the argument \code{add} is \code{FALSE} (see
below).}

\item{remove.intercept}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), do not plot the
ellipsoid for the intercept even if it is in the MANOVA table.}

\item{type}{``type'' of sum-of-squares-and-products matrices to compute; one
of \code{"II"}, \code{"III"}, \code{"2"}, or \code{"3"}, where \code{"II"}
is the default (and \code{"2"} is a synonym).}

\item{idata}{an optional data frame giving a factor or factors defining the
intra-subject model for multivariate repeated-measures data.  See Details of
\code{\link[car]{Anova}} for an explanation of the intra-subject design and
for further explanation of the other arguments relating to intra-subject
factors.}

\item{idesign}{a one-sided model formula using the ``data'' in idata and
specifying the intra-subject design for repeated measure models.}

\item{icontrasts}{names of contrast-generating functions to be applied by
default to factors and ordered factors, respectively, in the within-subject
``data''; the contrasts must produce an intra-subject model matrix in which
different terms are orthogonal. The default is c("contr.sum", "contr.poly").}

\item{imatrix}{In lieu of \code{idata} and \code{idesign}, you can specify
the intra-subject design matrix directly via \code{imatrix}, in the form of
list of named elements.  Each element gives the columns of the
within-subject model matrix for an intra-subject term to be tested, and must
have as many rows as there are responses; the columns of the within-subject
model matrix for \emph{different} terms must be mutually orthogonal.}

\item{iterm}{For repeated measures designs, you must specify one
intra-subject term (a character string) to select the SSPE (E) matrix used
in the HE plot.  Hypothesis terms plotted include the \code{iterm} effect as
well as all interactions of \code{iterm} with \code{terms}.}

\item{manova}{optional \code{Anova.mlm} object for the model; if absent a
MANOVA is computed. Specifying the argument can therefore save computation
in repeated calls.}

\item{size}{how to scale the hypothesis ellipse relative to the error
ellipse; if \code{"evidence"}, the default, the scaling is done so that a
``significant'' hypothesis ellipse at level \code{alpha} extends outside of
the error ellipse. \code{size = "significance"} is a synonym and does the same thing.
If \code{"effect.size"}, the hypothesis ellipse is on the
same scale as the error ellipse.}

\item{level}{equivalent coverage of ellipse  (assuming normally-distributed errors).
This defaults to \code{0.68}, giving a standard 1 SD bivariate ellipse.}

\item{alpha}{significance level for Roy's greatest-root test statistic; if
\code{size="evidence"} or \code{size="significance"}, then the hypothesis ellipse is scaled so that it
just touches the error ellipse at the specified alpha level. A larger
hypothesis ellipse \emph{somewhere} in the space of the response variables
therefore indicates statistical significance; defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{segments}{number of segments composing each ellipsoid; defaults to \code{40}.}

\item{col}{a color or vector of colors to use in plotting ellipsoids; the
first color is used for the error ellipsoid; the remaining colors ---
recycled as necessary --- are used for the hypothesis ellipsoid.  A single
color can be given, in which case it is used for all ellipsoid.  For
convenience, the default colors for all heplots produced in a given session
can be changed by assigning a color vector via \code{options(heplot3d.colors=c(...)}.  
Otherwise, the default colors are \code{c("pink", "blue",
"black", "darkgreen", "darkcyan", "magenta", "brown", "darkgray")}.}

\item{lwd}{a two-element vector giving the line width for drawing ellipsoids
(including those that degenerate to an ellipse) and for drawing ellipsoids
that degenerate to a line segment. The default is \code{c(1, 4)}.}

\item{shade}{a logical scalar or vector, indicating whether the ellipsoids
should be rendered with \code{\link[rgl]{shade3d}}. Works like \code{col},
except that \code{FALSE} is used for any 1 df degenerate ellipsoid.}

\item{shade.alpha}{a numeric value in the range [0,1], or a vector of such
values, giving the alpha transparency for ellipsoids rendered with
\code{shade=TRUE}.}

\item{wire}{a logical scalar or vector, indicating whether the ellipsoids
should be rendered with \code{\link[rgl]{wire3d}}. Works like \code{col},
except that \code{TRUE} is used for any 1 df degenerate ellipsoid.}

\item{bg.col}{background colour, \code{"white"} or \code{"black"},
defaulting to \code{"white"}.}

\item{fogtype}{type of ``fog'' to use for depth-cueing; the default is
\code{"none"}. See \code{\link[rgl]{bg}}.}

\item{fov}{field of view angle; controls perspective.  See
\code{\link[rgl]{viewpoint}}.}

\item{offset}{proportion of axes to off set labels; defaults to \code{0.01}.}

\item{xlab}{x-axis label; defaults to name of the x variable.}

\item{ylab}{y-axis label; defaults to name of the y variable.}

\item{zlab}{z-axis label; defaults to name of the z variable.}

\item{xlim}{x-axis limits; if absent, will be computed from the data.}

\item{ylim}{y-axis limits; if absent, will be computed from the data.}

\item{zlim}{z-axis limits; if absent, will be computed from the data.}

\item{cex.label}{text size for ellipse labels}

\item{add}{if \code{TRUE}, add to the current plot; the default is
\code{FALSE}.  If \code{TRUE}, the error ellipsoid is neither plotted nor
returned in the output object.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, print the MANOVA table and details of
hypothesis tests; the default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{warn.rank}{if \code{TRUE}, do not suppress warnings about the rank of
the hypothesis matrix when the ellipsoid collapses to an ellipse or line;
the default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{heplot3d} invisibly returns a list containing the bounding
boxes of the error (E) ellipsoid and for each term or linear hypothesis
specified in the call.  Each of these is a 2 x 3 matrix with rownames "min"
and "max" and colnames corresponding to the variables plotted. An additional
component, \code{center}, contains the coordinates of the centroid in the
plot.

The function also leaves an object named \code{.frame} in the global
environment, containing the rgl object IDs for the axes, axis labels, and
bounding box; these are deleted and the axes, etc.  redrawn if the plot is
added to.
}
\description{
This function plots ellipsoids in 3D representing the hypothesis and error
sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for terms and linear hypotheses in a
multivariate linear model.
}
\details{
When the H matrix for a term has rank < 3, the ellipsoid collapses to an
ellipse (rank(H)=2) or a line (rank(H)=1).

Rotating the plot can be particularly revealing, showing views in which H
variation is particularly large or small in relation to E variation.  See
\code{\link[rgl]{play3d}} and \code{\link[rgl]{movie3d}} for details on
creating animations.

The arguments \code{xlim}, \code{ylim}, and \code{zlim} can be used to
expand the bounding box of the axes, but cannot decrease it.
