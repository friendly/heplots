\title{Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models}
\description{
The \code{heplots} package provides functions for visualizing hypothesis
tests in multivariate linear models (MANOVA, multivariate multiple
regression, MANCOVA, and repeated measures designs).  HE plots represent
sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for linear hypotheses and for error
using ellipses (in two dimensions), ellipsoids (in three dimensions), or by
line segments in one dimension. See Fox, Friendly and Monette (2007) for a
brief introduction and Friendly, Monette and Fox (2013) for a general
discussion of the role of elliptical geometry in statistical understanding.
}
\details{
Other topics now addressed here include robust MLMs, tests for equality of
covariance matrices in MLMs, and chi square Q-Q plots for MLMs.

The package also provides a collection of data sets illustrating a variety
of multivariate linear models of the types listed above, together with
graphical displays.

Several tutorial vignettes are also included.  See
\code{vignette(package="heplots")}.

The graphical functions contained here all display multivariate model
effects in variable (data) space, for one or more response variables (or
contrasts among response variables in repeated measures designs).

\describe{ 
\item{list(list("heplot"))}{constructs two-dimensional HE plots
for model terms and linear hypotheses for pairs of response variables in
multivariate linear models.}

\item{list(list("heplot3d"))}{constructs analogous 3D plots for triples of
response variables.}

\item{list(list("pairs.mlm"))}{constructs a ``matrix'' of pairwise HE
plots.}

\item{list(list("heplot1d"))}{constructs 1-dimensional analogs of HE plots
for model terms and linear hypotheses for single response variables.} 
}

For repeated measure designs, between-subject effects and within-subject
effects must be plotted separately, because the error terms (E matrices)
differ.  For terms involving within-subject effects, these functions carry
out a linear transformation of the matrix \bold{Y} of responses to a matrix
\bold{Y M}, where \bold{M} is the model matrix for a term in the
intra-subject design and produce plots of the H and E matrices in this
transformed space. The vignette \code{repeated} describes these graphical
methods for repeated measures designs.

The related \pkg{car} package calculates Type II and Type III tests of
multivariate linear hypotheses using the \code{\link[car]{Anova}} and
\code{\link[car]{linearHypothesis}} functions.

The \code{\link[candisc]{candisc-package}} package provides functions for
visualizing effects for MLM model terms in a low-dimensional canonical space
that shows the largest hypothesis relative to error variation. The
\pkg{candisc} package now also includes related methods for canonical
correlation analysis.

The \code{heplots} package also contains a large number of multivariate data
sets with examples of analyses and graphic displays.  Use
\code{data(package="heplots")} to see the current list.
