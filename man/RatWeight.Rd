\title{Weight Gain in Rats Exposed to Thiouracil and Thyroxin}
\format{
A data frame with 27 observations on the following 6 variables.
\describe{ 
  \item{\code{trt}}{a factor with levels \code{Control} \code{Thiouracil} \code{Thyroxin}} 
  \item{\code{wt0}}{Weight at Week 0 (baseline weight)} 
  \item{\code{wt1}}{Weight at Week 1}
  \item{\code{wt2}}{Weight at Week 2} 
  \item{\code{wt3}}{Weight at Week 3}
  \item{\code{wt4}}{Weight at Week 4} 
}

Originally from Box (1950), Table D (page 389), where the values for
weeks 1-4 were recorded as the gain in weight for that week.

\description{
The data are from a study of weight gain, where investigators randomly
assigned 30 rats to three treatment groups: treatment 1 was a control (no
additive); treatments 2 and 3 consisted of two different additives
(thiouracil and thyroxin respectively) to the rats drinking water. Weight
was measured at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Due to an
accident at the beginning of the study, data on 3 rats from the thyroxin
group are unavailable.
}
\details{
The \code{trt} factor comes supplied with contrasts comparing \code{Control}
to each of \code{Thiouracil} and \code{Thyroxin}.
