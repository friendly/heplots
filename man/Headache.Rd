\description{
A study was conducted investigating the effectiveness of different kinds of
psychological treatment on the sensitivity of headache sufferers to noise,
described in Hand and Taylor (1987), Study E.
}
\details{
In a pre-post design, 98 patients were first assessed for the volume of
noise which they found uncomfortable (U) and definitely uncomfortable (DU).
They were then given relaxation training, where they listened to the noise
at the DU level and given instruction breathing techniques and the use of
visual imagery to distract them from discomfort.  One of four treatments was
then applied, and all patients were reassessed for the noise volume they
considered uncomfortable (U) and definitely uncomfortable (DU).

The treatments are described as follows: 
\describe{
  \item{\code{T1}}{Listened again to the tone at their initial DU level, for
         the same amount of time they were able to tolerate it before.}
  \item{\code{T2}}{Same as T1, with one additional minute exposure}
  \item{\code{T3}}{Same as T2, but were explicitly instructed to use the
        relaxation techniques} 
  \item{\code{Control}}{These subject experienced no
        further exposure to the noise tone until the final sensitivity measures were taken} 
}

Hand and Taylor described several substantive hypotheses related to the
differences among treatments. In the \code{Headache} data frame, these have
been included as \code{contrasts(Headache$treatment)}
