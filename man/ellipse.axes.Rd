\title{Draw axes of a 3D ellipsoid}
\usage{
ellipse.axes(
  x,
  centre = c(0, 0),
  center = center,
  scale = c(1, 1),
  level = 0.95,
  t = sqrt(qchisq(level, 2)),
  which = 1:2,
  labels = TRUE,
  label.ends = c(2, 4),
  label.pos = c(4, 2, 3, 1),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A square positive definite matrix at least 3x3 in size.  It will be
treated as the correlation or covariance of a multivariate normal
distribution.}

\item{centre, center}{The center of the ellipse}

\item{scale}{If x is a correlation matrix, then the standard deviations of
each parameter can be given in the scale parameter.  This defaults to
\code{c(1, 1, 1)}, so no rescaling will be done.}

\item{level}{The coverage level of a simultaneous region.  The
default is 0.95, for a 95\% region.  This is used to control the size of the
ellipsoid.}

\item{t}{The size of the ellipsoid may also be controlled by specifying the
value of a t-statistic on its boundary, which defaults to the square root of a chi-square statistic
for a given \code{level} on 3 degrees of freedom.}

\item{which}{An integer vector to select which variables from the object will be
plotted.  The default is the first 2.}

\item{labels}{Either a logical value, a character string, or a character
vector of length 2.  If \code{TRUE}, the default, the axes are labeled PC1,
PC2.  If a single character string, the digits 1, and 2 are pasted on
the end.}

\item{label.ends}{}

\item{label.pos}{}

\item{...}{}

\value{
Invisibly returns the end points of the axes

\description{

covariance or sums of squares and cross products matrix.
