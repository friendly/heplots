\description{
Male participants were shown a picture of one of three young women.  Pilot
work had indicated that the one woman was beautiful, another of average
physical attractiveness, and the third unattractive.  Participants rated the
woman they saw on each of twelve attributes.  These measures were used to
check on the manipulation by the photo.
}
\details{
Then the participants were told that the person in the photo had committed a
Crime, and asked to rate the seriousness of the crime and recommend a prison
sentence, in Years.

Does attractiveness of the "defendant" influence the sentence or perceived
seriousness of the crime?  Does attractiveness interact with the nature of
the crime?

# manipulation check:  test ratings of the photos classified by Attractiveness

# influence of Attr of photo and nature of crime on Serious and Years
jury.mod2 <- lm( cbind(Serious, Years) ~ Attr * Crime, data=MockJury)
car::Anova(jury.mod2, test="Roy")
heplot(jury.mod2)

# stepdown test (ANCOVA), controlling for Serious
jury.mod3 <- lm( Years ~ Serious + Attr * Crime, data=MockJury)
car::Anova(jury.mod3)

# need to consider heterogeneous slopes?
jury.mod4 <- lm( Years ~ Serious * Attr * Crime, data=MockJury)
car::Anova(jury.mod3, jury.mod4)
