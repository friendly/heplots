\title{School Data}
\format{
A data frame with 70 observations on the following 8 variables.

\describe{ 
  \item{\code{education}}{Education level of mother as measured in
      terms of percentage of high school graduates among female parents}
  \item{\code{occupation}}{ Highest occupation of a family member according
      to a pre-arranged rating scale} 
  \item{\code{visit}}{ Parental visits index
     representing the number of visits to the school site}
  \item{\code{counseling}}{ Parent counseling index calculated from data on
      time spent with child on school-related topics such as reading together, etc.} 
  \item{\code{teacher}}{ Number of teachers at a given site}
  \item{\code{reading}}{ Reading score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test} 
  \item{\code{mathematics}}{Mathematics score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test} 
  \item{\code{selfesteem}}{Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, intended as a measure of self-esteem}

\description{
School Data, from Charnes et al. (1981). The aim is to explain scores on 3
different tests, \code{reading}, \code{mathematics} and \code{selfesteem}
from 70 school sites by means of 5 explanatory variables related to parents
and teachers.
}
\details{
This dataset was shamelessly borrowed from the \code{FRB} package.

The relationships among these variables are unusual, a fact only revealed by
plotting.
