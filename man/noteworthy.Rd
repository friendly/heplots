\title{Find noteworthy (unusual) points in a 2D plot}
\usage{
noteworthy(x, y, n = length(x), method = "mahal", level = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Plot coordinate: x}

\item{y}{Plot coordinate: y}

\item{n}{Maximum number of points to identify}

\item{method}{Method of point identification. See Details.}

\item{level}{Where appropriate, if supplied, the identified points are filtered so that only those for which the 
criterion is \code{< level}}

\item{...}{Other arguments, silently ignored}
}
\description{
This function extends the logic used by \code{\link[car]{showLabels}} to provide a more general
collection of methods to identify unusual or "noteworthy" points in a two-dimensional display.
Standard methods include Mahalanobis  and Euclidean distance from the centroid, absolute value of distance from 
the mean of X or Y, absolute value of Y and absolute value of the residual in a model \code{Y ~ X}.
}
\details{
The `method` argument determines how the points to be identified are selected:
\describe{
 \item{\code{"mahal"}}{Treat (x, y) as if it were a bivariate sample, 
      and select cases according to their Mahalanobis distance from \code{(mean(x), mean(y))}.}
 \item{\code{"dsq"}}{Similar to \code{"mahal"} but uses squared Euclidean distance.}  
 \item{\code{"x"}}{Select points according to their value of \code{abs(x - mean(x))}.}
 \item{\code{"y"}}{Select points according to their value of \code{abs(y - mean(y))}.}
 \item{\code{"r"}}{Select points according to their value of \code{abs(y)}, as may be appropriate 
      in residual plots, or others with a meaningful origin at 0, such as a chi-square QQ plot.}
 \item{\code{"ry"}}{Fit the linear model, \code{y ~ x} and select points according to their absolute residuals.}
 \item{case IDs}{\code{method} can be an integer vector of case numbers in \code{1:length{x}}, in which case those cases 
      will be labeled.}
 \item{numeric vector}{\code{method} can be a vector of the same length as x consisting of values to determine the points 
      to be labeled. For example, for a linear model \code{mod}, setting \code{method=cooks.distance(mod)} will label the 
      \code{n} points corresponding to the largest values of Cook's distance. Warning: If missing data are present, 
      points may be incorrectly selected.}
}

In the case of \code{method == "mahal"} a value for \code{level} can be supplied.
This is used as a filter to select cases whose criterion value
exceeds \code{level}. In this case, the number of points identified will be less than or equal to \code{n}.
