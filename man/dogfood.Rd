\description{
A tiny hypothetical dataset to illustrate one-way MANOVA.

A dogfood manufacturer wanted to study preference for different dogfood formulas, two of their own
("Old", "New") and two from other manufacturers ("Major", "Alps"). In a between-dog design, 4 dogs
were presented with a bowl of one \code{formula} and the time to \code{start} eating and \code{amount} eaten were recorded.
