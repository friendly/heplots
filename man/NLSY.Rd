\title{National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Data}
\format{
A data frame with 243 observations on the following 6 variables.
\describe{ 
  \item{\code{math}}{Math achievement test score}
  \item{\code{read}}{Reading achievement test score}
  \item{\code{antisoc}}{score on a measure of child's antisocial behavior, \code{0:6}} 
  \item{\code{hyperact}}{score on a measure of child's
        hyperactive behavior, \code{0:5}} \item{\code{income}}{yearly income of child's father} 
  \item{\code{educ}}{years of education of child's father} 
}

This dataset was derived from a larger one used by Patrick Curran at
the 1997 meeting of the Society for Research on Child Development (SRCD). A
description now only exists on the WayBack Machine,

\description{
The dataset `NLSY` comes from a small part of the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, which is a series of annual surveys conducted by the 
U.S. Department of Labor to examine the transition of young people into the labor force.
This particular subset gives measures of 243 children on mathematics and reading achievement and also
measures of behavioral problems (antisocial, hyperactivity). Also available are the yearly income
and education of the child's father.
}
\details{
In this dataset, \code{math} and \code{read} scores are taken at the outcome
variables. Among the remaining predictors, \code{income} and \code{educ}
might be considered as background variables necessary to control for.
Interest might then be focused on whether the behavioral variables
\code{antisoc} and \code{hyperact} contribute beyond that.
