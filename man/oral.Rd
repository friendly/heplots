\description{
Postovsky (1970) investigatged the effect of delay in oral practice at the beginning of second language learning.
A control condition began oral practice with no delay, while an experimental group had a four-week delay before
starting oral practice. The data consists of scores on language skills at the end of six weeks of study.

Students in this study were matched on age, education, former language training, intelligence and language aptitude.
