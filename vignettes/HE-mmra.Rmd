# Multivariate Multiple Regression Designs

The ideas behind HE plots extend naturally to multivariate multiple
regression (MMRA) and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). 
In MMRA designs, the $\mathbf{X}$ matrix contains only quantitative predictors, while
in MANCOVA designs, it contains a mixture of
factors and quantitative predictors (covariates), but typically there is just
one "group" factor.

In the MANCOVA case,
there is often a subtle difference in emphasis:  true MANCOVA analyses focus on
the differences among groups defined by the factors, adjusting for 
(or controlling for) the quantitative covariates. Analyses concerned
with \emph{homogeneity of regression} focus on quantitative predictors
and attempt to test whether the regression relations are the same for
all groups defined by the factors.

## Rohwer data

To illustrate the homogeneity of regression flavor,
we use data
from a study by Rohwer (given in @Timm:75, Ex. 4.3, 4.7, and 4.23)
on kindergarten children, designed to determine how well a set of
paired-associate (PA) tasks predicted performance on the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary test (`PPVT`), a student achievement test (`SAT`),
and the Raven Progressive matrices test (`Raven`). The PA tasks
varied in how the stimuli were presented, and are called *named* (`n`), *still* (`s`), *named still* (`ns`), 
*named action* (`na`), and *sentence still* (`ss`).

Two groups were tested: a group of $n=37$ children from a low socioeconomic
status (SES) school, and a group of $n=32$ high SES children from an
upper-class, white residential school. The data are in the data frame 
`Rohwer` in the `heplots` package:
```{r, rohwer-some}
data(Rohwer)
Rohwer |> dplyr::sample_n(6)
```

### Preliminary plots

Before fitting models, it is usually useful to do some data exploration and graphing.
With multivariate multiple regression data, among the most helpful plots are scatterplots
of each response variable, Y, against each predictor, X, and we can get a better sense of
the relationships by adding linear regression lines, loess smooths or other enhancements.

A scatterplot matrix, using `graphics::pairs()` or `GGally::ggpairs()` is easy to do.
However, with 3 response variables, 4 predictors and a group factor (`SES`), this can
be overwhelming. An alternative is to compose a rectangular matrix of plots for 
only the Y variables against the Xs.

This turned out to be not as easy as it might seem, because none of the `pairs()` methods
allow for this possibility.  The trick is to reshape the data from wide to long format
and use facets in `ggplot2` to compose the pairwise scatterplots into the desired 
rectangular matrix format.[^1]

[^1]: This solution was suggested in an answer to a Stackoverflow question, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73859139/how-to-make-a-scatterplot-rectangular-matrix-y1-y2-x1-x2-in-r

<!-- TODO: retain original variable order -->

```{r rohwer-long}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

yvars <- c("SAT", "PPVT", "Raven" )      # outcome variables
xvars <- c("n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss")   # predictors
xvars <- c("n", "s", "ns")               # make a smaller example

Rohwer_long <- Rohwer %>%
  dplyr::select(-group, -na, -ss) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = all_of(xvars), 
                      names_to = "xvar", values_to = "x") |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = all_of(yvars), 
                      names_to = "yvar", values_to = "y")
Rohwer_long
```

Then, we can use `ggplot2` to make produce the pairwise plots for each combination of `x` and `y` variables. Using `color=SES` in the aesthetic results in a separate regression line for
the two SES groups produced by `geom_smooth()`.

```{r rohwer-long-ggplot}
#| fig.width=8,
#| fig.heigth=10,
#| fig.cap="Plot matrix of the response variables (`SAT`, `PPVT` and `Raven`) against each of three predictors (`n`, `s`, `ns`). The lines show separate linear regressions for each SES group."
ggplot(Rohwer_long, aes(x, y, color = SES, shape = SES)) +
  geom_jitter(size=1.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE, 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              size=1.5) +
  facet_grid(yvar ~ xvar,            # plot matrix of Y by X
             scales = "free") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

Such plots form a framework for understanding model fits and statistical tests we turn to now.


### Separate models

As one approach, we might be tempted to fit separate regression models for each
of the High and Low SES groups.  This approach is *not* recommended because it
lacks power and does not allow hypotheses about equality of slopes and intercepts
to be tested directly.

```{r, rohwer-separate}
rohwer.ses1 <- lm(cbind(SAT, PPVT, Raven) ~ n + s + ns + na + ss, data=Rohwer, subset=SES=="Hi")
Anova(rohwer.ses1)

rohwer.ses2 <- lm(cbind(SAT, PPVT, Raven) ~ n + s + ns + na + ss, data=Rohwer, subset=SES=="Lo")
Anova(rohwer.ses2)
```

This fits separate slopes and intercepts for each of the two groups, but it is difficult
to compare the coefficients numerically.
```{r, rohwer-coef}
coef(rohwer.ses1)
coef(rohwer.ses2)
```

The function `heplots::coefplot()` makes this a bit easier, by plotting bivariate confidence ellipses for the
coefficients in a multivariate linear model. In this problem, with three response variables,
the 95% confidence regions are 3D ellipsoids, but we only plot them in 2D.
The 3D versions have the property that a given predictor is significant by a multivariate test if
the ellipsoid excludes the point (0, 0, 0).


```{r rohwer-coefplot}
#| echo=-1,
#| out.width="47%",
#| out.height="50%",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| collapse=FALSE,
#| fig.cap="Coefficient plots for the separate models for the High and Low SES groups in the Rohwer data. The ellipses are 95% confidence regions for the pairs of regression coefficients of (SAT, PPVT) for each predictor in the model."
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
coefplot(rohwer.ses1, fill=TRUE, cex.label=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
text(-10, 3, "High SES group", pos=4, cex=1.4)

coefplot(rohwer.ses2, fill=TRUE, cex.label=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
text(-4.7, 2.5, "Low SES group", pos=4, cex=1.4)
```

Alternatively, we can visualize the results of the multivariate tests for the predictors
with HE plots. Here we make use of the fact
that several HE plots can be overlaid using the option `add=TRUE`
as shown in \@ref(fig:rohwer-HE1).

```{r, rohwer-HE1}
#| echo=-1,
#| out.width="60%",
#| fig.cap="HE plot for `SAT` and `PPVT`, showing the effects for the PA predictors	for the High and Low SES groups separately"
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
heplot(rohwer.ses1, 
       ylim=c(40,110),                        # allow more room for 2nd plot
       col=c("red", "black"), 
       fill = TRUE, fill.alpha = 0.1,
       lwd=2, cex=1.2)
heplot(rohwer.ses2, 
       add=TRUE, 
       col=c("brown", "black"), 
       grand.mean=TRUE, error.ellipse=TRUE,   # not shown by default when add=TRUE
       fill = TRUE, fill.alpha = 0.1,
       lwd=2, cex=1.2)
# label the groups at their centroid
means <- aggregate(cbind(SAT,PPVT)~SES, data=Rohwer,  mean)
text(means[,2], means[,3], labels=means[,1], pos=3, cex=2, col="black")
```

We can readily see the difference in means for the two SES groups (`Hi` has greater scores on both variables)
and it also appears that the slopes of the predictor ellipses are shallower for the High
than the Low group, indicating greater relation with the `SAT` score. 

### MANCOVA model

Alternatively (and optimistically), we can fit a MANCOVA model 
that allows different means for the two SES groups on the responses, but constrains the
slopes for the PA covariates to be equal.

```{r, rohwer-mod}
# MANCOVA, assuming equal slopes
rohwer.mod <- lm(cbind(SAT, PPVT, Raven) ~ SES + n + s + ns + na + ss, 
                 data=Rohwer)
Anova(rohwer.mod)
```

Note that, although the
multivariate tests for two of the covariates (`ns` and `na`)
are highly significant, univariate multiple regression tests for the
separate responses [from `summary(rohwer.mod)`] are relatively weak.

We can also test the global 5 df hypothesis, $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{0}$, 
that *all* covariates have null effects
for all responses as a linear hypothesis. 
First, extract the names
of the PA tests predictors from the model.
`car::linearHypothesis()` takes a vector of the names coefficients to be tested simultaneously.

```{r, rohwer-cov-names}
covariates  <- c("n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss")
# or: covariates <- rownames(coef(rohwer.mod))[-(1:2)]
```


```{r, rohwer-mod-test}
Regr <- linearHypothesis(rohwer.mod, covariates)
print(Regr, digits=4, SSP=FALSE)
```

Then 2D views of the
additive MANCOVA model `rohwer.mod` and the overall test for all covariates
are produced as follows, giving the plots in \@ref(fig:rohwer-HE2).

```{r, rohwer-HE2}
#| echo=-1,
#| out.width="47%",
#| out.height="50%",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| collapse=FALSE,
#| fig.cap="HE plot for `SAT` and `PPVT` (left) and for	`SAT` and `Raven` (right) using the MANCOVA model. The ellipses labeled 'Regr' show the test of the overall model, including all predictors."
par(mar=c(4,4,3,1)+.1)
colors <- c("red", "blue", rep("black",5), "#969696")
heplot(rohwer.mod, 
       col=colors, variables=c(1,2),
       hypotheses=list("Regr" = covariates),
       fill = TRUE, fill.alpha = 0.1,
       cex=1.5, lwd=c(2, rep(3,5), 4),
       main="(SAT, PPVT) in Rohwer MANCOVA model")

heplot(rohwer.mod, 
       col=colors,  variables=c(1,3),
       hypotheses=list("Regr" = covariates),
       fill = TRUE, fill.alpha = 0.1,
       cex=1.5, lwd=c(2, rep(3,5), 4),
       main="(SAT, Raven) in Rohwer MANCOVA model")
```


The positive orientation of the `Regr` ellipses shows that the predicted
values for all three responses are positively correlated (more so for
`SAT` and `PPVT`). As well, the High SES group
is higher on all responses than the Low SES group.

Alternatively, all pairwise plots among these responses could be drawn using
the `pairs.mlm()` function,

```{r, rohwer-HE3}
#| fig.width=6,
#| fig.height=6
pairs(rohwer.mod, col=colors,
      hypotheses=list("Regr" = c("n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss")),
      cex=1.3, lwd=c(2, rep(3,5), 4))
```

or as a 3D plot, using `heplot3d()` as shown in \@ref{fig:rohwer-HE3D}.
```{r, rohwer-HE3D-code, eval=FALSE}
colors <- c("pink", "blue", rep("black",5), "#969696")
heplot3d(rohwer.mod, col=colors,
	hypotheses=list("Regr" = c("n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss")))
```
```{r rohwer-HE3D}
#| echo=FALSE,
#| out.width="60%",
#| fig.cap="3D HE plot for the MANCOVA model fit to the Rohwer data."
knitr::include_graphics("fig/mmra-rohwer-HE3D.png")
```

### Testing homogeneity of regression

The MANCOVA model, `rohwer.mod`, has relatively simple interpretations
(large effect of `SES`, with `ns` and `na` as the major predictors)
but the test of relies on the assumption of homogeneity of slopes for the predictors.
We can test this assumption as follows, by adding interactions of `SES`
with each of the covariates:

```{r, rohwer-mod2}
rohwer.mod2 <- lm(cbind(SAT, PPVT, Raven) ~ SES * (n + s + ns + na + ss),
                  data=Rohwer)
Anova(rohwer.mod2)
```
It appears from the above that there is only weak evidence of unequal slopes
from the separate `SES:` terms. The evidence for heterogeneity is
stronger, however, when these terms are tested collectively using the 
`linearHypothesis()` function:

```{r, rohwer-mod2-test}
(coefs <- rownames(coef(rohwer.mod2)))
print(linearHypothesis(rohwer.mod2, coefs[grep(":", coefs)]), SSP=FALSE)
```

This model (`rohwer.mod2`) is similar in spirit to the two models
(`rohwer.ses1` and `rohwer.ses2`)
fit for the two SES groups separately and show in \@ref{fig:rohwer-HE1},
except that model `rohwer.mod2` assumes a common within-groups error covariance matrix
and allows overall tests.

To illustrate model `rohwer.mod2`, we construct an HE plot for
`SAT` and `PPVT` shown in \@ref{fig:rohwer-HE4}. 
To simplify this display, we show the hypothesis ellipses\
for the overall effects of the PA tests in the baseline high-SES group, and
a single combined ellipse for all the `SESLo:` interaction terms that
we tested previously, representing differences in slopes between the low and
high-SES groups. 

Because SES is "treatment-coded" in this model, the ellipse for each
covariate represents the hypothesis that the slopes for that covariate are
zero in the high-SES baseline category.  With this parameterization, the ellipse for
`Slopes` represents the joint hypothesis that slopes for the covariates do not differ
in the low-SES group. 

```{r, rohwer-HE4}
#| echo=-1,
#| out.width="70%",
#| fig.cap="HE plot for `SAT` and `PPVT`, fitting the model `rohwer.mod2`	that allows unequal slopes for the covariates."
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
colors <- c("red", "blue", rep("black",5), "#969696")
heplot(rohwer.mod2, col=c(colors, "brown"), 
      terms=c("SES", "n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss"), 
      hypotheses=list("Regr" = c("n", "s", "ns", "na", "ss"),
                      "Slopes" = coefs[grep(":", coefs)]))
```

Comparing \@ref{fig:rohwer-HE4} for the heterogeneous slopes model
with \@ref{fig:rohwer-HE2} (left) for the homogeneous slopes model,
it can be seen that most of the covariates have ellipses of similar
size and orientation, reflecting similar evidence against the respective
null hypotheses, as does the effect of `SES`, showing the
greater performance of the high-SES group on all response measures.
Somewhat more subtle, the error ellipse is noticeably smaller in
\@ref{fig:rohwer-HE4}, reflecting the additional variation accounted
for by differences in slopes.

## Recovery from hernia repair

This example uses the `Hernior` data (from @MostellerTukey:1977, Data Exhibit 8, p. 567-568),
comprising
data on measures of post-operative recovery of 32 patients undergoing an
elective herniorrhaphy operation, in relation to pre-operative measures.

The outcome measures are:

* the patient's condition upon leaving the recovery room (`leave`, a 1-4 scale, 1=best),
* level of nursing required one week after operation (`nurse`, a 1-5 scale, 1=worst) and 
* length of stay in hospital after operation (`los`, in days)

The predictor variables are: 

* patient `age`, `sex`,
* physical status (`pstat`, a 1-5 scale, with 1=perfect health, 5=very poor health),
* body build (`build`, a 1-5 scale, with 1=emaciated, ..., 5=obese), and
* preoperative complications with (`cardiac`) heart and respiration (`resp`), 1-4 scales, 1=none, ..., 4=severe.
<!-- The ordinal predictors could be treated as factors, but we use them here as numeric variables. -->

```{r hern-str}
data(Hernior)
str(Hernior)
```


We begin with a model fitting all predictors. Note that the ordinal predictors,
`pstat`, `build`, `cardiac` and `resp` could arguably be treated as
factors, rather than linear, regression terms.  Doing so would give tests for
nonlinear effects of their relations with the responses.
We ignore this possibility in this example.

```{r, hern1}
Hern.mod <- lm(cbind(leave, nurse, los) ~ age + sex +  pstat +  build + cardiac + resp, 
               data=Hernior)
Anova(Hern.mod) 
```
The results of the multivariate tests above are somewhat disappointing.  Only the physical status
predictor (`pstat`) appears to be significant at conventional levels.

The univariate models for each response are implicit in the MLM `Hern.mod`.
These can be printed using `summary()`, or we can use `summary()` to extract
certain statistics for each univariate response model, as we do here.

```{r, hern.rsq}
Hern.summary <- summary(Hern.mod)
unlist(lapply(Hern.summary, function(x) x$r.squared))
```

<!-- TODO: use glance.mlm() here -->

The univariate tests for predictors in each of these models (not shown here)
are hard to interpret, and largely show only significant effects for 
the `leave` variable.  Yet, the $R^2$ values for the other responses
are slightly promising.  We proceed to an overall test of $\mathbf{B} = 0$
for all predictors, whose term names can be easily extracted from the
rownames of the coefficients.

```{r, hern2}
# test overall regression
(predictors <- rownames(coef(Hern.mod))[-1])
Regr <- linearHypothesis(Hern.mod, predictors)
print(Regr, digits=5, SSP=FALSE)
```

```{r, hern-pairs}
#| fig.width=7,
#| fig.height=7,
#| fig.cap="HE pairs plot for Hernior data"
clr <- c("red", "darkgray", "blue", "darkgreen", "magenta", "brown", "black")
vlab <- c("LeaveCondition\n(leave)", 
          "NursingCare\n(nurse)", 
          "LengthOfStay\n(los)")

hyp <- list("Regr" = predictors)
pairs(Hern.mod, 
      hypotheses=hyp, 
      col=clr, var.labels=vlab, 
      fill=c(TRUE,FALSE), fill.alpha = 0.1, 
      cex=1.25)
```


A `pairs()` plot for the MLM gives the set of plots shown in \@ref{fig:hern-pairs}
helps to interpret the relations among the predictors which lead to the highly significant
overall test.
Among the predictors, age and sex have small and insignificant effects on the outcome measures
jointly.  The other predictors all contribute to the overall test of $\mathbf{B} = 0$,
though in different ways for the various responses.
For example, in the panel for (`leave`, `los`) in  \@ref{fig:hern-pairs},
it can be seen that while only `pstat` individually is outside the 
$\mathbf{E}$ ellipse, `build` and `resp` contribute to the overall test in
an opposite direction.

### Canonical analysis

In this multivariate regression example, all of the terms in the model `Hern.mod`
have 1 df, and so plot as lines in HE plots.  An alternative view of these effects
can be seen in canonical discriminant space, which, for each predictor shows the
scores on the linear combination of the responses that contributes most to 
the multivariate test of that effect, together with the weights for the responses.

We use `candiscList()` to calculate the canonical analyses for all predictor terms in
`Hern.mod`.
```{r, hern-canL}
Hern.canL <- candiscList(Hern.mod)
```

1D canonical discriminant plots for all terms can be obtained interactively 
with a menu, simply by plotting the `Hern.canL` object.
```{r, hern.canL2, eval=FALSE}
plot(Hern.canL)
```
Plots for separate terms are produced by the lines below, and shown in 
\@ref(fig:hern-can1) and \@ref(fig:hern-can2).

For `pstat` and `build`:

```{r, hern-can1}
#| out.width="47%",
#| out.height="50%",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| collapse=FALSE,
#| fig.cap="1D Canonical discriminant plots for physical status (`pstat`) and `build`. The canonical scores are such that better outcomes are associated with smaller scores."
plot(Hern.canL, term="pstat")
plot(Hern.canL, term="build")
```

For `age` and `cardiac`:

```{r, hern-can2}
#| out.width="47%",
#| out.height="50%",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| collapse=FALSE,
#| fig.cap="1D Canonical discriminant plots for `age` and `cardiac`. The canonical scores are such that better outcomes are associated with smaller scores."
plot(Hern.canL, term="age")
plot(Hern.canL, term="cardiac")
```

In these plots, the canonical scores panel shows
the linear combinations of the
response variables which have the largest possible $R^2$.
Better outcomes correspond to numerically smaller canonical scores.
The arrows in the structure panel are proportional to
the canonical weights.

These plots provide simple interpretations of the results for the
canonical combinations of the responses.
Better physical status, smaller body build, lower age and absence
of cardiac complications are all positively related to better outcomes.

## Grades in a Sociology Course

The data set `SocGrades` contains four outcome measures on student performance
in an introductory sociology course together with six potential predictors.
These data were used by @MarascuiloLevin:1983 for an example of
canonical correlation analysis, but are also suitable as examples of
multivariate multiple regression, MANOVA, MANCOVA
and step-down analysis in multivariate linear models.

The outcome measures used here are three test scores during the course,
`midterm1`, `midterm2`, `final`,
and a course evaluation (`eval`).[^2]

[^2]:It is arguable that the students' course evaluation should not
	be considered a response variable here.  It could be used as a
	predictor in a follow-up, 	step-down analysis, which would address the separate
	question of	whether the effects on exam grades remain, when `eval` is	controlled for.  


Predictor variables are:

* the student's social class (`class`, an ordered factor with levels `1` > `2` > `3`)
*  `sex`,
*  grade point average (`gpa`),
*  College Board test scores (`boards`),
*  previous high school unit in sociology?  (`hssoc`: with values `no`, `yes`), and
*  score on a course pretest (`pretest`).

```{r}
str(SocGrades)
```

### Models

The basic MLM is fit below as `grades.mod`.

```{r, grades1}
data(SocGrades)
grades.mod <- lm(cbind(midterm1, midterm2, final, eval) ~ 
	                     class + sex + gpa + boards + hssoc + pretest, 
                 data=SocGrades)
Anova(grades.mod, test="Roy")
```

In both univariate and multivariate
response models, it is often useful to screen for higher-order
terms (interactions, non-linear predictors).  This can most easily be
done using `update()`, as we do below.  First, try the extended
model with all pairwise interactions of the predictors.
In the model formula, `~.^2`, the `.` represents all terms in the model,
and the `^2` generates all products of terms, such as `class:sex`.

```{r, grades2}
grades.mod2 <- update(grades.mod, . ~ .^2)
Anova(grades.mod2, test="Roy")
```

In the results above, only the interaction of `class:sex` is significant,
and the main effects of `hssoc` and `pretest` remain insignificant.
A revised model to explore is `grades.mod3`,

```{r, grades3}
grades.mod3 <- update(grades.mod, . ~ . + class:sex - hssoc - pretest)
Anova(grades.mod3, test="Roy")
```

A pairwise HE plot for all responses (\@ref(fig:grades-pairs) shows that nearly all 
effects are in the expected directions: higher `gpa`, `boards`, `class`
leads to better performance on most outcomes.  The interaction of
`class:sex` seems to be confined largely to `midterm1`.
```{r, grades-pairs}
#| out.width="90%",
#| fig.cap="HE pairs plot for SocGrade, model `grades.mod3`."
pairs(grades.mod3)
```



These effects are easier to appreciate for the three exam grades jointly in a
3D HE plot when you can rotate it interactively. A snapshot is shown in \@ref(fig:grades-HE3D).  
```{r, grades-HE3D, eval=FALSE}
heplot3d(grades.mod3, wire=FALSE)
```
```{r}
#| echo=FALSE,
#| out.width="70%",
#| fig.cap="3D HE plot for SocGrades, model `grades.mod3`"
knitr::include_graphics("fig/grades-HE3D.png")
```

<!-- 	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{grades-HE3D} -->
<!-- \caption{3D HE plot for SocGrades, model `grades.mod3`} -->
<!--  {#fig:grades-HE3D} -->

Interactive
rotation of this plot shows that the effect of `class` is only two dimensional,
and of these, one dimension is very small.  The major axis of the `class` ellipsoid
is aligned with increasing performance on all three grades, with the expected
ordering of the three social classes.

### Canonical analysis
The representation of these effects in canonical space is particularly useful here.
Again, use `candiscList()` to compute the canonical decompositions for all terms
in the model, and extract the canonical $R^2$ from the terms in the result.

```{r, grades4}
# calculate canonical results for all terms
grades.can <- candiscList(grades.mod3)
# extract canonical R^2s
unlist(lapply(grades.can, function(x) x$canrsq))
```

We use `heplot()` on the `"candiscList"` object to show
the effects of `class` in canonical space, giving \@ref(fig:grades-can-class).
```{r, grades-can-class}
#| echo=-1,
#| out.width="80%",
#| fig.cap="Canonical HE plot for `class` effect in  `grades.mod3`"
 par(xpd=TRUE)
# plot class effect in canonical space
 heplot(grades.can, term="class", 
        scale=4, fill=TRUE, var.col="black", var.lwd=2)
```

It can be seen in \@ref{fig:grades-can-class} that nearly all variation
in exam performance due to class is aligned with the first canonical dimension.
The three tests and course evaluation all have similar weights on this dimension,
but the course evaluation differs from the rest along a second, very small
dimension.

1D plots of the canonical scores for other effects in the model are also of
interest, and provide simple interpretations of these effects on the response
variables.  The statements below produce the plots shown in \@ref(fig:grades-can-all).  
```{r, grades-can-all}
#| out.width="47%",
#| out.height="50%",
#| fig.show="hold",
#| collapse=FALSE,
#| fig.cap="1D Canonical discriminant plots for `sex` and `gpa`. Higher canonical scores reflect better course performance."
plot(grades.can, term="sex")
plot(grades.can, term="gpa")
```

It is readily seen that males perform better overall, but the effect of
`sex` is strongest for the `midterm2`.
As well, increasing course performance on tests is strongly associated with
`gpa`.
