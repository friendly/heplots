Description: Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
    tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products 
    matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using ellipses (in two
    dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three dimensions). It also provides other tools for analysis and graphical display of the models
    such as robust methods and homogeneity of variance covariance matrices.
    The related 'candisc' package provides visualizations in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space when
    there are more than a few response variables.
