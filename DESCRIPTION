Description: Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
    tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-
    products matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using ellipses (in two
    dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three dimensions). The related "candisc" package
    provides visualizations in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space when
    there are more than a few response variables.
