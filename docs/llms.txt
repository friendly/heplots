## **Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models**

Version 1.8.0; documentation built for `pkgdown` 2025-12-05

## Description

The `heplots` package provides functions for visualizing hypothesis
tests in multivariate linear models (“MLM” = {MANOVA, multivariate
multiple regression, MANCOVA, and repeated measures designs}). It also
provides other tools for analysis and graphical display of MLMs.

HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for linear
hypotheses (**H**) and for error (**E**) using ellipses (in two
dimensions), ellipsoids (in three dimensions), or by line segments in
one dimension. For the theory and applications, see:

Other topics now addressed here include:

- robust MLMs, using iteratively re-weighted least squared to
  down-weight observations with large multivariate residuals,
  [`robmlm()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/robmlm.md).
- [`Mahalanobis()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/Mahalanobis.md)
  calculates classical and *robust* Mahalanobis squared distances using
  MCD and MVE estimators of center and covariance.
- visualizing tests for equality of covariance matrices in MLMs (Box’s M
  test),
  [`boxM()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/boxM.md) and
  [`plot.boxM()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/plot.boxM.md).
  Also:
  [`bartlettTests()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/bartlettTests.md)
  and `LeveneTests()` for homogeneity of variance for each response in a
  MLM.
- $`\chi^2`$ Q-Q plots for MLMs
  ([`cqplot()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/cqplot.md))
  to detect outliers and assess multivariate normality of residuals.
- bivariate coefficient plots showing elliptical confidence regions
  ([`coefplot()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/coefplot.md)).

In this respect, the `heplots` package now aims to provide a wide range
of tools for analyzing and visualizing multivariate response linear
models, together with other packages:

[![candisc

- The related [`candisc`](https://friendly.github.io/candisc/) package
  provides HE plots in **canonical discriminant** space, the space of
  linear combinations of the responses that show the maximum possible
  effects and for canonical correlation in multivariate regression
  designs. See the [package
  documentation](https://friendly.github.io/candisc/) for details.

[![mvinfluence
logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friendly/mvinfluence/master/man/figures/logo.png)](https://friendly.github.io/mvinfluence/)

- Another package,
  [`mvinfluence`](https://friendly.github.io/mvinfluence/), provides
  diagnostic measures and plots for **influential observations** in MLM
  designs. See the [package
  documentation](https://friendly.github.io/mvinfluence/) for details.

Several tutorial vignettes are also included. See
`vignette(package="heplots")`.

## Installation

|  |  |
|----|----|
| CRAN version | `install.packages("heplots")` |
| R-universe | `install.packages("heplots", repos = c('https://friendly.r-universe.dev')` |
| Development version | `remotes::install_github("friendly/heplots")` |

## HE plot functions

The graphical functions contained here all display multivariate model
effects in variable (**data**) space, for one or more response variables
(or contrasts among response variables in repeated measures designs).

- [`heplot()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/heplot.md)
  constructs two-dimensional HE plots for model terms and linear
  hypotheses for pairs of response variables in multivariate linear
  models.

- [`heplot3d()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/heplot3d.md)
  constructs analogous 3D plots for triples of response variables.

- The `pairs` method,
  [`pairs.mlm()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/pairs.mlm.md)
  constructs a scatterplot matrix of pairwise HE plots.

- [`heplot1d()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/heplot1d.md)
  constructs 1-dimensional analogs of HE plots for model terms and
  linear hypotheses for single response variables.

## Other functions

- [`glance.mlm()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/glance.mlm.md)
  extends
  [`broom::glance.lm()`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/reference/glance.lm.html)
  to multivariate response models, giving a one-line statistical summary
  for each response variable.
  [`uniStats()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/uniStats.md)
  does something similar, but formatted more like a ANOVA table.

- [`boxM()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/boxM.md)
  Calculates Box’s *M* test for homogeneity of covariance matrices in a
  MANOVA design. A `plot` method displays a visual representation of the
  components of the test. Associated with this, `bartletTests()` and
  `levineTests()` give the univariate tests of homogeneity of variance
  for each response measure in a MLM.

- [`covEllipses()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/covEllipses.md)
  draw covariance (data) ellipses for one or more group, optionally
  including the ellipse for the pooled within-group covariance.

- [`coefplot()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/coefplot.md)
  for an MLM object draws bivariate confidence ellipses.

### Repeated measure designs

For repeated measure designs, between-subject effects and within-subject
effects must be plotted separately, because the error terms (**E**
matrices) differ. For terms involving within-subject effects, these
functions carry out a linear transformation of the matrix **Y** of
responses to a matrix **Y M**, where **M** is the model matrix for a
term in the intra-subject design and produce plots of the **H** and
**E** matrices in this transformed space. The vignette `"repeated"`
describes these graphical methods for repeated measures designs. (This
paper [HE plots for repeated measures
designs](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v37/i04/paper) is now provided as a
PDF vignette.)

## Examples

This example illustrates HE plots using the classic `iris` data set. How
do the means of the flower variables differ by `Species`? This dataset
was the impetus for R. A. Fisher (1936) to propose a method of
discriminant analysis using data collected by Edgar Anderson (1928).
Though some may rightly deprecate Fisher for being a supporter of
eugenics, Anderson’s `iris` dataset should not be blamed.

A basic HE plot shows the **H** and **E** ellipses for the first two
response variables (here: `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`). The
multivariate test is significant (by Roy’s test) *iff* the **H** ellipse
projects *anywhere* outside the **E** ellipse.

The positions of the group means show how they differ on the two
response variables shown, and provide an interpretation of the
orientation of the **H** ellipse: it is long in the directions of
differences among the means.

``` r
iris.mod <- lm(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ 
                 Species, data=iris)
heplot(iris.mod)
```

![HE plot of sepal length and Sepal width for the iris
data](reference/figures/README-iris1-1.png)

### Contrasts

Contrasts or other linear hypotheses can be shown as well, and the
ellipses look better if they are filled. We create contrasts to test the
differences between `versacolor` and `virginca` and also between
`setosa` and the average of the other two. Each 1 df contrast plots as
degenerate 1D ellipse– a line.

Because these contrasts are orthogonal, they add to the total 2 df
effect of `Species`. Note how the first contrast, labeled `V:V`,
distinguishes the means of *versicolor* from *virginica*; the second
contrast, `S:VV` distinguishes `setosa` from the other two.

``` r
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
contrasts(iris$Species)<-matrix(c(0, -1, 1, 
                                  2, -1, -1), nrow=3, ncol=2)
contrasts(iris$Species)
#>            [,1] [,2]
#> setosa        0    2
#> versicolor   -1   -1
#> virginica     1   -1
iris.mod <- lm(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ 
                 Species, data=iris)

hyp <- list("V:V"="Species1","S:VV"="Species2")
heplot(iris.mod, hypotheses=hyp, 
       fill=TRUE, fill.alpha=0.1)
```

lines reflecting two contrasts among iris
species.](reference/figures/README-iris2-1.png)

reflecting two contrasts among iris species.

### All pairwise HE plots

All pairwise HE plots are produced using the
[`pairs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/pairs.html) method for MLM
objects.In the plot, note how the means of most pairs of variables are
very highly correlated, in the order Setosa \< Versicolor \< Virginica,
but this pattern doesn’t hold for relations with `Sepal.Width`.

``` r
pairs(iris.mod, hypotheses=hyp, hyp.labels=FALSE,
      fill=TRUE, fill.alpha=0.1)
```

data.](reference/figures/README-iris3-1.png)

### Canonical discriminant view

For more than two response variables, a multivariate effect can be
viewed more simply by projecting the data into canonical space — the
linear combinations of the responses which show the greatest differences
among the group means relative to within-group scatter. The computations
are performed with the [`candisc`](https://github.com/friendly/candisc/)
package, which has an `heplot.candisc()` method.

``` r
library(candisc)
iris.can <- candisc(iris.mod) |> print()
#> 
#> Canonical Discriminant Analysis for Species:
#> 
#>    CanRsq Eigenvalue Difference  Percent Cumulative
#> 1 0.96987   32.19193     31.907 99.12126     99.121
#> 2 0.22203    0.28539     31.907  0.87874    100.000
#> 
#> Test of H0: The canonical correlations in the 
#> current row and all that follow are zero
#> 
#>   LR test stat approx F numDF denDF   Pr(> F)    
#> 1      0.02344  199.145     8   288 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> 2      0.77797   13.794     3   145 5.794e-08 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

The HE plot in canonical space shows that the differences among species
are nearly entirely one-dimensional. The weights for the variables on
the first dimension show how `Sepal.Width` differs from the other size
variables.

``` r
# HE plot in canonical space
heplot(iris.can, var.pos = 1, scale = 40)
```

![Canonical HE plot for the iris
data](reference/figures/README-iris-can-1.png)

### Covariance ellipses

MANOVA relies on the assumption that within-group covariance matrices
are all equal. It is useful to visualize these in the space of some of
the predictors.
[`covEllipses()`](https://friendly.github.io/heplots/reference/covEllipses.md)
provides this both for classical and robust (`method="mve"`) estimates.
The figure below shows these for the three Iris species and the pooled
covariance matrix, which is the same as the **E** matrix used in MANOVA
tests.

``` r
covEllipses(iris[,1:4], iris$Species)
covEllipses(iris[,1:4], iris$Species, 
            fill=TRUE, method="mve", add=TRUE, labels="")
```
