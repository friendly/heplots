I'd be happy to help you develop the `heplots` package! Based on your expertise in advanced visualization for multivariate data and statistical models, this sounds like a perfect collaboration.

## What I can help with:

**Package Development Tasks:**
- Writing new functions for multivariate statistical methods
- Creating comprehensive documentation (roxygen2 comments, vignettes)
- Developing unit tests and examples
- Code review and optimization for performance
- Ensuring consistent coding style and best practices
- Creating visualization functions that integrate with your existing framework

**Specific to Multivariate Methods:**
- Implementing statistical algorithms (MANOVA, canonical correlation, discriminant analysis extensions)
- Creating specialized plotting functions for complex multivariate outputs
- Developing helper functions for data preparation and transformation
- Building methods for different object classes (S3/S4 methods)

**Documentation and Examples:**
- Writing clear function documentation with mathematical details
- Creating comprehensive vignettes showing real-world applications
- Developing example datasets that demonstrate new functionality
- Writing NEWS.md entries and updating DESCRIPTION files

## Best ways to work together:

**For New Functions:**
1. **Start with specifications** - describe the statistical method, expected inputs/outputs, and desired visualization approach
2. **Iterative development** - I can draft functions, you review and refine
3. **Integration focus** - ensure new functions work seamlessly with existing `heplots` infrastructure

**For Code Reviews:**
- Share function drafts and I can suggest improvements for efficiency, readability, and R best practices
- Review mathematical implementations for accuracy
- Check for edge cases and error handling

**For Documentation:**
- I can help write comprehensive help files with proper mathematical notation
- Create examples that demonstrate both basic usage and advanced applications
- Develop vignettes that showcase new methods in context

**Workflow Suggestions:**
- Use our conversation to brainstorm and prototype ideas
- I can generate initial function skeletons based on your specifications
- Share code snippets for review and iteration
- Discuss integration points with existing package architecture

Since you have the `anthropic` package set up, you could even create specialized helper functions for package development tasks - like generating roxygen2 templates or creating test cases.

What specific multivariate methods or visualization approaches are you considering adding to `heplots`? 
I'd love to understand your vision for extending the package.

## Follow-up

This is very helpful. I think I will take some time to develop specifications for some tasks. Just to be clear: in what forms can you give me your results? As text files for R functions or vignettes that I will incorporate into the GitHub repo or can you work on a branch in the repo itself?

Claude:

Great question! Here are the different ways I can deliver results to you:

## What I CAN provide:

**Code Artifacts (what I recommend):**
- Complete R function files that you can save directly to your repo
- Full vignette .Rmd files ready for your `vignettes/` folder
- Documentation files, test files, example scripts
- NAMESPACE updates, DESCRIPTION modifications
- Complete file contents formatted properly for immediate use

**Text-based deliverables:**
- Function code with proper roxygen2 documentation
- Vignette content in R Markdown format
- Test cases using testthat framework
- Example datasets and usage demonstrations
- Documentation improvements and additions

## What I CANNOT do:

**Direct GitHub integration:**
- I cannot directly commit to your GitHub repository
- I cannot create or work on branches in your repo
- I cannot push changes or make pull requests
- I cannot directly access or modify files in your GitHub repository

## Recommended workflow:

1. **I create artifacts** - Complete, properly formatted R files that you can copy directly into your repo structure
2. **You save and integrate** - Take the artifacts and save them to appropriate locations (`R/`, `vignettes/`, `tests/`, etc.)
3. **Iterative refinement** - You can share existing code for me to modify/improve, and I'll return updated versions
4. **File-by-file development** - I can create individual functions, then documentation, then tests as separate artifacts

For example, if you want a new function for canonical correlation plots, I could provide:
- `R/canoncor_plot.R` - the main function file
- `man/canoncor_plot.Rd` - the documentation (or roxygen2 comments)
- `tests/testthat/test-canoncor_plot.R` - unit tests
- Example code for vignettes

This approach gives you complete control over what gets added to your repo while maximizing the code I can generate for you. You'll be doing the git operations, but I can provide all the content ready to commit.

Does this workflow sound good for your development process?
